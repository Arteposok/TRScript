# TRS (Tool Runner Scripts)

## Who is this for?
This is a carefully selected and crafted together set of scripts that do common stuff, so I'd say
this is for those of us who are tired of typing up poems and romances while trying to push a repo to github, but really - this is for everybody.

## What is this
I kinda ansvered this question already, but we'll get more technical now, this is a ret of python scripts, the main script can be aliased to 
`trs` to allow you to access the commands directly, to add a command (you are welcome to), you write a function in a file in scripts - please
add any code not realted to that (like helper functions) to `utils.py` - and then add a command handler that consumes that function in main.py

## P.S.
You are welcome to you this with uv, it's ar simple as `sudo apt install uv` is,but it will help a lot with dependency management as it downloads tham into a venv automatically

## THANK YOU
